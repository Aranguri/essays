    "F1: We use the harmonic mean for the F1 score averaging over the precision and recall because (a) we are using rates {todo: how?} (b) we want both precision and recall to be high. To understand (b), think about labeling everything as a positive example. Then we would have a recall of 100% (there are no negative cases.) But our precision would be low. In particular, if our precision is 0 and recall is 1, the harmonic mean yields 0 (where as )\n",

    "Say we are a snail that goes at 1 mph in uphill and at 2 mph in downhill. If we travel for one hour in downhill and for other hour in uphill, then the average speed is 1.5 mph. Now, what if we want to travel the same distance uphill and downhill? Say we have a 1 mile road. What's the average speed? The average speed should be nearer 1 than 2, because we spend more time at 1 mph than at 2 mph. In uphill, we take 1 hour. In downhill, we take 1 / 2 hours. So, we traveled 1 + 1 = 2 miles in 1 + 1/2 = 1.5 hours. The average mph is 2 / 1.5 = 1.33. The general case is 2 / (1/a + 1/b,) because one over x mph means how much time I take to travel one mile. \n",
