Now, y and z are whatever we want. So we move the right tip of the segment y, z to touch the left tip of the segment x + y, x + z. So far we have z = x + y. Notice the segments have length x now (first segment has length x + y - y. second: x + z - z.) Now translate both segments so as to have its center (where the tips touch) at 0. We now have a tip in -x, two tips in 0, and one tip in x. The segments meant that the right tip was greater than the left tip. Note we only assumed x > 0.
