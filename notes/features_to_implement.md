#Higher- and lower-level agencies
Learning could happen in layers. We use an inner layer to learn the outer layer. We only activate the outer layer when it passes the tests. One way to see this is that the new layer is a new version of the old layer. Another way is that the outer layer bases in the inner layer to do higher-level actions.

As we grow, I think that a set of a few agencies dominates the others in the low-level. For instance, I don’t have many ways to write in a keyboard (low-level action.) However, I do have different choices in how I decide to write (high-level action.)

#Concepts
Each action is a set of concepts. Decompose stuff.
##Connecting them
How do we know which agencies to put together? joining two random agencies doesn't work. draw analogy when an intersection between fields is interesting

A kite can be strongly connected to string but lowly to red and white. If they are conflicts in the connections with red, they are easily suppressed.

#Reality's model
How to continue: water system. Distributing neg water block doesn't work.

No hay una simetría entre las acciones de moverse a la derecha y a la izquierda en la entrada en la red (por ejemplo.)

Si tenés un valle como si fuera una linea (dobleando una hoja) podés mandar a cero el weight para no tener que computa
r.

Think it like a graph

#Reflection
Develop a way of reflection.
The difference between brains and normal machines is that brains use processes that change themselves. That's key for AI. We shouldn't think of AI as a fixed machine. The brain can reflect and improve on its own.
What would it happen if we build a GAN system where both networks share a goal (ie, they benefit if the system improves)? The test system could give feedback about how to improve to the generator system and vice versa.

#Diffs and data reduction
Diffs: A lot of things can be represented by differences. Let’s say we are in state A and know that with procedure P we arrive to Z. Let’s call D the differences between A and Z. Later on, if we observe differences D we can infer that P was the cause.

Try using sensors that only feed the diff

An interesting place to research is how humans use data reduction. Nothing happens twice, so how can we develop skills to unexpected scenarios? How can we know that a tree is a tree? Because we have a general model of a tree. How do we store that tree? With an accumulation of seen trees, we surely developed a model that says how a tree should be.

#Conscious and unconscious
but maybe what makes it different is its organization. The brain, I think, doesn't work as a general-purpose machine. Maybe the conscious work that way. But the unconscious seems to have different agencies and rules for each type of work we want to do.

#Medium-term AI
AI research explores the short-term, during life learning (reinforcement learning) and the long-term, through lots of generations learning (neuroevolution.) What about the power of societies, parent-to-child learning, and other ideas developed in the last twenty century? Explore that.
We have ideals that define how much we care about our goals. These ideals should be reasonably stable. It can work as a long-term memory through generations. Social proudness and taboos could be another way to guide rational decisions.

#RL
"Double" q learning. The double is arbitrary there. Why can't we add three or more networks? So we can change and later test them
Can novelty search be applied to RL?

#Others
The brain usually puts together two agencies if they process something related (e.g., how large is an object.) This should be recreated in an AI.
How to achieve memory?
Continually test the program's prediction of reality against reality.
is it useful to have a model of the model? it could help in reducing the complexity n^2 => log(n) of a search.
hardcoded stuff: stomach, aim for discoveries, energy consumption (reduce complexity)
subject the agent to random conversations (like in the real world)
In the real world, the distance between each processor can vary. (That's a way of measuring time)
The hyper parameters should be tuned by evolution
